# python-problem-solving

Clean Python solutions focused on control flow, state tracking, and readable problem solving.

## Purpose

This repository is my structured practice space to become a **professional Python developer**.
It documents my progress as I learn to:
- break problems into smaller steps,
- write clear, maintainable solutions,
- validate behavior with tests,
- build a public record of consistent improvement.

This is a **learning repository**, not a final portfolio project. I will also build **2–3 production-style portfolio projects** separately.

## What you’ll find here

- **problems/**: Problem statements and solutions grouped by concept (for example: `control_flow/`, `grouping/`).
- **tests/**: Simple tests that verify solution behavior and protect refactors.
